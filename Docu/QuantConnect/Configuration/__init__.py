# If quantconnect-stubs is installed via pip and Lean is ran locally,

# interpreter look in the quantconnect-stubs package for the implementation.

# The desired behavior is for the interpreter to use the implementation
# provided by the AddReference() call from Python.NET.
#
# To fix this, we temporarily remove the directory containing the
# quantconnect-stubs package from sys.path and re-import the current namespace
# so the relevant C# namespace is used when running Lean locally.

# Find the directory containing quantconnect-stubs (usually site-packages)
